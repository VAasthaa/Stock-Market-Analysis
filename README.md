# Stock-Market-Analysis
S&P 500 is a stock market index tat measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock sxchanges in the US.
In this project, I have performed data analysis to comapare stocks of 4 companies - APPLE , AMAZON , GOOGLE and MICROSOFT and obtain insights about closing price trends, moving average of various stocks, resampling analysis of closing price,etc.
The main libraries used are numpy, pandas for data collection and analysis. I have used matplotlib and seaborn to visualise data through line graph, pairplot graph, cluster chart, etc.
